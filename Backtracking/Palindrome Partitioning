Problem Statement: You are given a string s, partition it in such a way that every substring is a palindrome. Return all such palindromic partitions of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = “aab”

Output: [ ["a","a","b"], ["aa","b"] ]	

Explanation: The first  answer is generated by  making three partitions. The second answer is generated by making two partitions.
example 2 : 
Input: s = “aabb”

Output: [ [“a”,”a”,”b”,”b”], [“aa”,”bb”], [“a”,”a”,”bb”], [“aa”,”b”,”b”] ]




#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    vector < vector < string >> partition(string s) {
      vector < vector < string > > res;
      vector < string > path;
      partitionHelper(0, s, path, res);
      return res;
    }

  void partitionHelper(int index, string s, vector < string > & path,
    vector < vector < string > > & res) {
    if (index == s.size()) {
      res.push_back(path);
      return;
    }
    for (int i = index; i < s.size(); ++i) {
      if (isPalindrome(s, index, i)) {
        path.push_back(s.substr(index, i - index + 1));
        partitionHelper(i + 1, s, path, res);
        path.pop_back();
      }
    }
  }

  bool isPalindrome(string s, int start, int end) {
    while (start <= end) {
      if (s[start++] != s[end--])
        return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
};
int main() {
  string s = "aabb";
  Solution obj;
  vector < vector < string >> ans = obj.partition(s);
  int n = ans.size();
  cout << "The Palindromic partitions are :-" << endl;
  cout << " [ ";
  for (auto i: ans) {
    cout << "[ ";
    for (auto j: i) {
      cout << j << " ";
    }
    cout << "] ";
  }
  cout << "]";

  return 0;
}
Output:

The Palindromic partitions are :-
[ [ a a b b ] [ a a bb ] [ aa b b ] [ aa bb ] ]

Time Complexity: O( (2^n) *k*(n/2) )

Reason: O(2^n) to generate every substring and O(n/2)  to check if the substring generated is a palindrome. O(k) is for inserting the palindromes in another data structure, where k  is the average length of the palindrome list.

Space Complexity: O(k * x)

Reason: The space complexity can vary depending upon the length of the answer. k is the average length of the list of palindromes and if we have x such list of palindromes in our final answer. The depth of the recursion tree is n, so the auxiliary space required is equal to the O(n).
